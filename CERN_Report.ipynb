    "<h1>1. Introduction:</h1> \n",
    "The name boson comes from the surname of an Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, an extraodinary physicist from the early twentieth century who worked alongside Albert Einstein to develop a method of analysis called Bose-Einstein Statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "A boson is a type of particle that obeys the rules of Bose-Einstein Statistics. Bose-Einstein statistics describe one of two possible ways in which a collection of non-interacting, non-distinguishable particles may occupy a set of available discrete energy states at thermodynamic equilibrium. In that, the bosons hold a intrinsic spin which contains an integer value, such as 0, 1, -1, -2, 2, etc. Bosons behave differentely than other particles such as Fermions. In low temperatures, an unlimited amount of bosons can collect into the same energy state, a intersting phenomenon called \"condensation\". \n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important phenomenon, because we will be observing a particle that can overlap and coexist with other bosons. On the other hand, fermions cannot do this becuase they follow the Fermi-exclusion principle. The applications of boson comes in the forms of lasers, where photons can overlap and transform into a laser and or some matter can form the exotic state of Bose-Einstein condensate. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> The different fundamental Bosons are as follows: </b> \n",
    "1. <b>Photon</b> - known as the 'particle of light', but can behave as either a wave or a particle. Holds the property of electromagnetic interactions\n",
    "2. <b>Gluon</b> - binds together quarks to form protons and neutrons and holds the protons and neutrons together within an atom's nucleous. Holds the property of strong nuclear force. \n",
    "3. <b>W Boson</b> - Holds the property of weak nuclear force.\n",
    "4. <b>Z Boson</b> - Holds the property of weak nuclear force. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b> How were we able to observe the Z boson? </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "While experimentation was being done during the Gargamelle bubble chamber experiment at CERN, the Z boson was detected. Neutrinos were in direct correlation to the discovery of the Z boson, in that, neutrinos only interact with weak forces. So, when neutrinos were accelerated through the bubble chamber, there was detection of a weak neutral current, and or evidence of the Z boson. "
